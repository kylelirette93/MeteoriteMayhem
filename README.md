## About
This game was created as a clone of the classic game Asteroids.
The player controls a ship that shoots bullets at moving meteorites. The amount of meteorites that spawn and the speed of them
is increased every level and a score is accumulated, displaying a high score on death. 
It was created as a fun learning project as I teach myself Game Development.
I've been learning programming for the past 8 months and mainly using Unity as a framework to create video games. 
I've been teaching myself through tutorials, books and Chat GPT.
This is my first completed game, other than a few tutorial projects.

## How to Play
The objective of the game is to destroy all the moving meteorites in the level. If the player does this, they will 
proceed to the next level, where another wave of meteorites will spawn. I'm not too familiar with optimization and aspect ratios
yet, so hopefully this will run on older machines.
